Hello! My name is Sebastian Joseph and welcome to my homepage. 

I am a second-year Master's student, and I am very interested in Natural Language Processing, especially Natural Language Generation. 

Right now, my main interest is in the area of high-stakes text simplification and the factuality evaluations of such simplifications.
