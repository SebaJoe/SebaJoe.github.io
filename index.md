Hello! My name is Sebastian Joseph and welcome to my homepage. 

I am a first-year Ph.D student at the University of Texas at Austin, I primarily work in the area of medical text simplification and the factuality evaluations of such simplifications. 

My interests span across all topics in NLP and Computational Linguistics. I love learning about language and how it can be understood and generated computationally.
